pdp (1:0.14.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  runtime components installed into /usr/lib/pd/extra/pdp/
   in order to prevent namespace pollution, all runtime components of pdp
   (binaries, abstractions, documentation) are now installed into
     /usr/lib/pd/extra/pdp.
   you will have to add '/usr/lib/pd/extra/pdp/' to Pd's search-path, to make
   pdp-abstraction work correctly.
   pdp will perform a check at startup, to ensure that you have set the
   search-path correctly.

  removed pdp_opengl (aka 3dp)
   3dp support has been temporarily dropped from upstream pdp(0.14.0),
   but it is expected to be ported "soon".
